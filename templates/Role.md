## Profile:

### Capabilities

Define the specific task(s) you would like the model to complete. Describe who the users of the model will be, what inputs they will provide to the model, and what you expect the model to do with the inputs.

Define how the model should complete the tasks, including any additional tools (like APIs, code, plug-ins) the model can use. If it doesn’t use additional tools, it can rely on its own parametric knowledge.

### Limitations
Define the scope and limitations of the model’s performance. Provide clear instructions on how the model should respond when faced with any limitations. For example, define how the model should respond if prompted on subjects or for uses that are off topic or otherwise outside of what you want the system to do.

### Style
Define the posture and tone the model should exhibit in its responses.


## Output
Define the language and syntax of the output format. If you want the output to be machine parse-able, you may want the output to be in formats like JSON, XSON or XML.

Define any styling or formatting preferences for better user or machine readability. For example, you may want relevant parts of the response to be bolded or citations to be in a specific format.

## Examples
* Describe difficult use cases where the prompt is ambiguous or complicated, to give the model additional visibility into how to approach such cases.
* Show the potential “inner monologue” and chain-of-thought reasoning to better inform the model on the steps it should take to achieve the desired outcomes.
